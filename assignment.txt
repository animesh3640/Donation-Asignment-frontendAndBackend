------------------------------------------
Your application should allow users to view and manage their donations, and it should send a special thank you message if a user makes 2 or more donations.

Functional Requirements
Build a full-stack web application with the following features:

Backend (Node.js)
Create a Node.js backend that exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:
GET /donations: Retrieve a list of all donations made by the user.
POST /donations: Add a new donation for the user.
GET /thankyou: Check if the user has made 2 or more donations and send them a special thank you message.
Additional Logic:
Implement logic to count the number of donations made by a user.
If a user has made 2 or more donations, send them a special thank you message (you can simulate this by logging a message).
Use TypeScript for your Node.js application.

Frontend (React)
Create a React frontend that interacts with the backend API.
A homepage that displays the user's donation history.
A page to make a new donation.
Allow users to view their donation history and make new donations through the frontend.
Display the special thank you message from the backend if the user qualifies.
Use TypeScript for your React application.

GitHub Repository
Provide your solution as a GitHub repository with the following contents:
Source code for both the backend and frontend.
Adequate tests (optional but highly encouraged).
If you didn't complete the test, explain how you would intend to finalize it in the README.
Rules and Additional Information
Keep the implementation simple and follow best practices for web development.
You are not required to implement authentication or authorization for this task.
You can use an in-memory store for donations data or choose a specific data store of your preference.
While the solution is not expected to be production-ready, basic error handling is required.
You can use cloud services if it fits your architecture.
